# DrawUITest

I'm just trying out the promising DrawnUI Framework for .net MAUI because i need a solution for a quick CollectionView with variable height cells that have a bit more complicated layout than just a StackView with a few labels.

this is a Demo-Repository to discuss (and hopefully solve) problems/questions i have with that. :)
